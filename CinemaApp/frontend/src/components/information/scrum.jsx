                The scrum framework was effectively implemented throughout the build of the
                product for this project. This was led by the scrum master, Emily, who
                conducted daily scrum meetings at 9am where the whole team reviewed the
                progression of the sprint and the allocation of items in the sprint backlog.
                Tasks were split into two five-day sprints which were all displayed on Jira,
                allowing team members to clearly view each item's status and assignee, and
                make changes where necessary. Consistent use of this board had a beneficial
                impact on the organisation and time-management of the project as sprint 1
                tasks were completed quickly and additional items from the product backlog
                could be added into the first sprint, leaving fewer items for the second
                sprint and more time to be spent on enhancing the product. The full design
                concept of the web application was developed by Shahmeen, the product owner,
                who defined the project vision and strategy, and rigorously guided the whole
                team during the entire process to work in relation to the product concept.
                Through incorporating scrum each individual was clear of their role at all
                times and the sprint goal was achieved to an exceptional standard. Positive
                and negative outcomes were assessed through the sprint review and
                retrospective which resulted in improved performance during the second sprint
                and subsequently the production of an excellent final product that surpassed
                the criteria of the minimum viable product.
